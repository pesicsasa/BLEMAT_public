# blemat_positioning_datasets
This is a repository of positioning datasets obtained from one of the BLEMAT deployment sites. 


Datasets starting with the keyword ‘raw’ represent the data collected and formatted prior to step 6. These datasets contain detected beacons and their positions in 3D. Datasets starting with the keyword ‘occupancy’ relate to the final datasets obtained after all 7 steps have been run. With respect to tenants privacy, only the Bluetooth data is made available, while the WiFi data is not disclosed. Furthermore, all timestamps and mac addresses of beacons have been scrambled.
